This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of implementations and explanations of essential data structures and algorithms, with a strong emphasis on problem-solving techniques relevant to technical interviews and academic study.
- To consolidate fundamental concepts in computer science and algorithm design.
- To provide a well-structured reference for revisiting core topics in data structures, algorithmic strategies, and computational complexity.
Standard topics covered:
-Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
-Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, etc.), Graphs, Heaps
-Sorting and Searching algorithms
-Recursion, Backtracking, Greedy algorithms
-Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and more
Example problems and solutions inspired by LeetCode, HackerRank, and others.
